This mini-project is from "Beginner's Step-by-Step Coding Course", written by DK Pub. This is a continuation of my career in software development and programming, following my graduation and certification from UC Berkeley's Data Analytics Extension Program. Although the difficulty of this project is rated beginner/easy, I felt that this project can help hone some of the fundamentals of programming in Python.
